Privacy and Confidentiality
No names will be stored. Stored information will be limited to the age and sex of the players and their game-related actions. These data will be sent directly to a server managed by ASUâ€™s Engineering Technical Services during the experiment. Recorded data will be protected by a password, only known by the investigators of the present experiment. All recorded data will be stored for an unlimited period of time (especially data that will lead to the publication of a scientific paper, as required by scientific journals). Data analyses will be only performed on anonymized data and demographic data (gender, age) will only be used to collect aggregate statistics.
