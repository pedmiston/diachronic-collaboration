# Invitation

You are invited to participate in a research study about problem solving and teamwork. You are invited because you are a healthy English-speaking adult. Your participation in this research study is _voluntary_.

# What is the purpose of this study?

The purpose of this study is to investigate how people work together in teams to solve problems. Specifically what we are interested in is the various ways people interact and share information when working together in a team, and the impact of team organization on the way problems are solved.

# What will my participation involve?

If you decide to participate in this research, you will be given a certain amount of time to work on some problem. For example, you might play a computer game where you have to build tools from different resources. Your participation in this research involves attempting to solve a clearly defined problem for the duration of the experiment.

The typical length of an experiment is between 30 and 60 minutes. You will have received a more accurate estimate of the duration of this study when you originally signed up. Please ask the experimenter for an accurate estimate of how long your participation will take.

You may be randomly assigned to work with at least one other participant in the study to form a team. You and your teammates are able to help each other solve the problem by sharing information with one another during the experiment task. Your participation may involve working in teams.

You may be asked to fill out questionnaires about your participation in the research. Some of these questions may ask you to reflect on the experiment and your approach to the problem solving task. These questions involve rating your own problem solving abilities as well as the abilities of any team members you may have interacted with. These responses will be kept private. You are not required to answer any questions you feel uncomfortable answering.

We may also collect the following information about you for this research study: your age, gender, and your family's language background. For some studies we will ask you to provide your email address so we can get in touch with you for scheduling follow-up studies. Participation in follow-up studies is entirely voluntary.

# Are there any benefits to me?

You are not expected to benefit directly from participating in this study. Your participation may benefit other people in the future by helping us learn more about the ways people effectively work together in teams.

# Will I be paid for my participation

You will receive research-study credit appropriate to the length of the study (2 points per hour in increments of $1/4$ point).

# Are there any side effects or risks to me?

There are no foreseeable risks to you from participating in this research.

# How will my privacy be protected?

All data files will be identified only with a participant number and not with your name. While there will likely be publications as a result of this study, your name will not be used. Any data published will be anonymized.

# Is my permission voluntary and may I change my mind?

Your permission is voluntary. You do not have to sign this form and you may refuse to do so. If you refuse to sign this form, however, you cannot take part in this research study. You may completely withdraw from the study at any time. You also may choose to cease participation at any point or skip any questions that you do not feel comfortable answering.

# Whom should I contact if I have questions?

Please take as much time as you need to think over whether or not you wish to participate. If you have any questions about this study at any time, contact the Principal Investigator Gary Lupyan at 608-262-4333.

If you are not satisfied with response of research team, have more questions, or want to talk with someone about your rights as a research participant, you should contact the Education Research and Social & Behavioral Science IRB Office at 608-263-2320.

Your participation is completely voluntary. If you decide not to participate or to withdraw from the study it will have no effect on any services you are currently receiving or your grade in a class.
