# Post experiment survey

After completing the Totems experiment, participants will be directed to take an online survey about their experience in the game. The primary purpose of this survey is to provide an opportunity for participants to relate any confusion they had about the task and their instructions. Some examples of questions participants might be asked are shown below.

Additional questions include asking participants about what they thought the primary experimental hypotheses were, how enjoyable the game was, how difficult the game was, and whether or not they employed a particular strategy in guessing combinations of resources.
