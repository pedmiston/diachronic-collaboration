_Please describe, in two to three sentences, the objective of your proposed research competition._

The objective of my proposed research competition is to better understand the role of inheritance in the problem solving abilities of individuals. Does inheriting someone else's Kernel simply give a head start on a problem, or does inheritance actually make for more effective problem solving? To answer this question, in this competition participants are randomly assigned to either begin on a solution from scratch or to inherit a solution from someone else.

_What impact would this competition have on the industry or space your organization specializes in?_

The purpose of this research is to demonstrate the ways in which human teams can work most efficiently, and to use these findings to attempt to draw conclusions about how our species evolved. I'm particularly interested in the evolution of human culture, and the ways in which the properties of evolutionary systems in biology and in computer science also apply to the products of human collaboration over generations. One such property is the value of iteration in achieving success in many problem solving domains. Although the properties of different

# Data

- Is this a supervised machine learning problem? **Yes**
- Do you have a dataset available? **Yes**
- How much data is available? **Yes** [_sic_]
- Is it available now? **Yes**
- Is it approved for public release? **Yes**

# Timeline

- The competition could be ready to launch: **In one month**
- The competition would need to be completed: **In six months**

_Please describe any specific time constraints or considerations for this project:_

This competition would need to be run as a timed trial, where participants are given a fixed amount of time to complete the problem. Minimally this can be done through the honor system and verified with timestamps, but I realize it is a departure from the standard Kaggle competition.

# Organizations and funding

How much funding do you have available for a cash prize? **$500**

_Are there any other opportunities being made available to winners?_

They will be given the option to join a mailing list for updates on research findings and future research participation opportunities.
