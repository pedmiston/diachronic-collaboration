# Looking for first time Kagglers

Do you know python or R and have training in statistics or machine learning? Have you wanted to try a Kaggle competition or other data science contest but haven't yet? Do you want to get paid to spend between 2 and 4 hours on such a problem?

The Lupyan Lab in the Department of Psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison is holding a mock Kaggle competition where participants can volunteer to participate in an experiment investigating how people solve problems. We hope that by studying how people approach open-ended problems like Kaggle competitions we can learn more about what makes humans unique problem solvers when compared to other animals.

If you decide to participate, first we'll verify your eligibility. Participants must be comfortable at least attempting a beginner Kaggle competition on their own. Then we will determine a time to conduct the experiment. By participating in this research, you agree to only working on a solution in the agreed upon timeframe. You will be given between 2 and 4 hours to come up with a solution.

You will be paid $10 an hour for your participation. After all participants have contributed solutions
