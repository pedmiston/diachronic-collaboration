# Menzies and Royalty Research Awards

Awards of $500 are given to fund independent research by graduate students. These awards are supported by Menzies and Royalty Research funds. 

To apply for the award, a one page, single spaced, 12 point standard font proposal must be submitted, summarizing your proposed research [conceptual background and research plan]. References should be included on a separate page. You should also indicate how you plan to use the award on a separate page. Proposals will be evaluated by all members of the Graduate Committee, so your proposal should be written to be understood by psychologists from many area groups.

Applications are accepted on a rolling basis throughout the year. A maximum of one application per student per calendar year may be submitted. Please send your application to the Graduate Studies and Admissions office via <gradinfo@psych.wisc.edu>.
